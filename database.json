The audio is from some podcasts, run through Adobe Audio Cleaning software, and trained with Eleven Labs. The lip-sync is done with RunwayML. I found that Scott's audio model is more effective because of the duration and stability of the training data. Dilbert's show is filled with music and noises, and in the moments it is not, the voice is often in a state of fear or anxiety. So parsing and finding a lot of stable Dilbert audio for cleaner training is a good next step."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I hope they find some stable audio of me panicking at work.
